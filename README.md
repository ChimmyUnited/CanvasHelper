# CanvasHelper
Uses the open-source Canvas LMS API in a Chrome extension to provide helpful tools.

One of the key enhancements is a more compact and organized view of assignments, intelligently sorted by their due dates. Additionally, I've incorporated advanced filtering capabilities, allowing you to quickly find assignments by class. I've also added the ability to create personal to-do items within Canvas.

I implemented notifications that keep you informed about upcoming deadlines. When you start your day, the extension provides notifications for any assignments due on that day. Additionally, you can customize notifications to receive reminders at a specified time before an assignment is due, ensuring you never miss an important deadline.

The extension also works with multiple Canvas accounts, allowing all assignments to be found in one place.

In order to load the extension, 
1. Extract `canvashelper.zip`
2. Open the Chrome extension page and turn on "Developer mode"
3. Load Unpacked

Built with React.js and TypeScript.
